## Using Wireless and Thermal Imaging Technology for Lameness Detection

[Repository](https://github.com/gearoidmurphy/FY_Project)

### Introduction 

In Agriculture one of the biggest worries is animal welfare and when we look to one specific area such as the dairy sector we see how animal welfare affects efficiency, productivity and fertility. This is why for this project I proposed a device that detects one of the biggest problems affecting a cows welfare which is lameness since this is something that can go untreated or even undetected it can be the worst problem for cows. As someone who has worked on a farm for many years I know that there aren't many solutions to this problem that actually catch lameness early on before they show actual signs of pain so this is why I decided that this would be the problem I want to try to solve in this project.

### Description
As I stated in the introduction I wanted to come up with a solution that can detect lameness and allow the user to treat the animal before it affects the animals welfare. This will be done through the use of thermal imaging on the cows foot as lameness causes an increase in temperature due to the pain. The end goal for this project is to create an automated system for a milking parlour when the cows enter and their tag number is got and a hoof reading taken so that it can notify the farmer when there is an unusually high temperature caused by lameness. Throughout the project I will use the knowledge I have gained in college and from my work experience but will also learn as much new technologies as possible.

### Inspiration 
Through my experience of working on a dairy farm I know that there are 3 main factors that lower animal welfare and productivity : infertility, mastitis and lameness. Out of the three lameness is the easiest to prevent early on. This is why I thought it would be a good idea to try to come up with a device that could detect it early on. After doing some research I found that there are monitoring systems that use motion sensors but this isn't very efficient for large herds.I found a paper about the use of thermal imaging which led to me using it in this project. After doing more research i found that “lameness is caused by infection (i.e. abscesses, CODD, foot rot) but may also be caused by injury (muscular injuries due to a kick for example), both of which can be identified by increased local temperature using a thermal imaging camera.”(The use of thermal imaging technology to enhance livestock production, 2019)

### Aims
The aims of this project are as follows: 
 - Come up with suitable method/s to detect Lameness in livestock that is affordable and non invasive.
 - Use existing knowledge of hardware, software and IoT platforms that will aid the direction of the end goal.
 - To Alert Users of lameness and relay the information needed to access what method to use to treat the animal.
 - To give users an overview of entire herds through stored data and trend graphs
 - Find Suitable hardware for the project
 - Set up a Thermal Imaging Camera and use the data 
 - Use Radio Frequency Identification to get the tag number of the cows in the herd
 - Create a fully functional android app 

### Methodology 
For the development of this project I've decided to go with the Agile approach. This is conducted through ‘sprints’. At the beginning of the semester I set out my goals and due dates for these sprints, each one allowing for flexibility.
